## About The Project

SmartHR is an innovative mobile application developed to streamline HR operations within organizations[cite: 8]. It functions as a mobile-first, AI-enabled, and cloud-native platform, replacing traditional, inefficient HR processes[cite: 1]. This project was developed as part of a BSc in Computer Science.

The system is built using React Native for the front end, Node.js/Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database[cite: 2, 100, 101], with integration of Microsoft Azure services for AI capabilities[cite: 2, 10, 27, 122, 137, 156]. Key functionalities include role-based authentication (for HR personnel and employees)[cite: 2, 9, 71, 91, 124], comprehensive task management (assignment and tracking)[cite: 2, 9, 71, 92, 125], GPS-verified check-in/checkout[cite: 2, 9, 71, 91, 126], employee issue reporting[cite: 9, 13, 71, 127], leave requests[cite: 9, 13, 71], real-time notifications and announcements[cite: 2, 9, 71, 129], and an AI-powered chatbot for HR support[cite: 2, 10, 15, 70, 128]. Robust security is ensured through JWT authentication[cite: 3, 32, 95, 101, 138, 146], data encryption[cite: 3, 33, 95], and role-based access control[cite: 3, 33, 96].
