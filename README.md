## About The Project

SmartHR is an innovative mobile application developed to streamline HR operations within organizations. It functions as a mobile-first, AI-enabled, and cloud-native platform, replacing traditional, inefficient HR processes[cite: 1]. This project was developed as part of a BSc in Computer Science.

The system is built using React Native for the front end, Node.js/Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database, with integration of Microsoft Azure services for AI capabilities. Key functionalities include role-based authentication (for HR personnel and employees), comprehensive task management (assignment and tracking), GPS-verified check-in/checkout, employee issue reporting, leave requests, real-time notifications and announcements], and an AI-powered chatbot for HR support. Robust security is ensured through JWT authentication, data encryption, and role-based access control.
